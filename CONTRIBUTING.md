further sublicensing of (parts of) VTT properTune to any party. [To make this

of the Contribution to VTT.  Contributor(s) making a Contribution to VTT
properTune thereby also makes a Transfer of Contribution Copyright. VTT has the
right to accept or refuse Contributions.

necessary rights, ownership, and copyright to the Contribution and that the
Contribution does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights,
such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights.

In case the Contributor is an organisation, it confirms that for the purposes of
this Agreement it has received all necessary rights from its personnel involved
on its behalf in making the Contribution. Such transfer may also be executed by
having this Agreement signed both by the organisation and its personnel involved
in making the Contribution

The transfer takes place upon the effective date when the Contribution is made
available on the web site, by such Contributors themselves or anyone acting on
such Contributors' behalf. The transfer is free of charge.
